# Cable Channel 
![img1](./img1.png)

**Note ⚠️:** The channel is designed for a 300mm v2.4/Trident. For other sizes, modifications to the channel will be necessary.

This is a cable channel for routing the front motor wires to the back of the gantry. While this channel is specifically designed for use with titanium backers, it can be used without them.
